 How far have we come right? When I close my eyes & listen—not to the noise of alarms, but to the voices of the past & whispers of the future—I see something different. I see purpose. I see civilizations that lived for something greater.

Somehow I genuinely feel that, we are trapped in a cycle where we dedicate time for mediocrity, & time is sold for degrees, projects, job profiles. But for what? For comfort? For the illusion of progress?

I accept that human past was filled with war, g**ocides & heinous civil disobedience. But at least, human were not burdened by 9-to-5 jobs, nor did they drown in credit card bills. They lived as though every day mattered.

Now many might say, Tetsu, you're privileged so you're dreaming for a life where barbaric pagans ruled. What is non paganism then? Your religious identity? Or your moral so called supremacy where you prefer to being stuck in a mediocre life for the security of Heaven?

You're not going to heaven. Somewhere in your heart, you too know, your life has been through the Hell & that's why your understanding of Heaven comes from the luxury of modern life.

Yes may be Viking era, Gupta era, Maurya era, Shogun era was doomed too. That's why they didn't sustain.

But neither this present day hyper competitive market will. Science, poetry, mathematics, & spirituality will take over mediocrity of the present & civilization will swear only knowledge as its ultimate wealth.
